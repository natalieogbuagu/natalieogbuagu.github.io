What I built: I attempted to build a very basic website with limited functionality

What I learned: I learned about HTML and how the web works starting with the address bar in the browser and defining protocols like DNS and HTTP. I also was able to brush up on my GitHub skills. 

What didn't work: I wasn't able to install the 'code' command on VS Code as instructed on the website.

Opinion: This project was actually way more time consuming than it should've been. I probably struggled more than others with it. However, it was cool to make my own website and I think it would be even cooler to make more complex websites.
